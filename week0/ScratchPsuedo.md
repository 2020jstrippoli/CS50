# Scratch Project

**Fish**
1. Making my own block that sets the size to 65% of the normal sprite
2. Makes the Sprite Appear
3. This is how the sprite moves up and down. sets the pace at which it is going
4. Sets location
5. If the sprite touches the color black, (which surround the shark), then you lose the game, sending the message game over to the other piece of code
6. This displays the end game screen and hides the sprite while doing so.

**Shark**
1. Shuts down all functions of the sprite when it receives the message game over
2. sets size of the shark
3. this produces multiple sharks. sets the frequency of them as well
4. Making my own block that sets the size to 65% of the normal sprite
5. sets  x location of the shark and randomizes the y location. When a shark appears it increments the score by 1 - Randomizes costume change. Sets the end x coordinate 
6. gets rid of the shark when it touches the color red.
7. sets score to -1, this is so that is you die on the first shark your score is zero

**Sprite-1**
1. sets location
2. Hides the sprite when the message game over is received

**Backdrop**
1. Initializes backdrop to Underwater 2
